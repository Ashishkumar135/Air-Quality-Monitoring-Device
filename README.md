# Air-Quality-Monitoring-Device
In this project we are going to make an IoT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System in which we will monitor the Air Quality over a webserver using internet and will trigger an alarm when the air quality goes down beyond a certain level, means when there are sufficient amount of harmful gases are present in the air like CO2, smoke, alcohol, benzene and NH3. It will show the air quality in PPM on the LCD and as well as on webpage so that we can monitor it very easily.
